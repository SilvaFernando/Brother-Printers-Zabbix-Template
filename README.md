Purpose: Monitor Brother Model SNMP enabled printers.
Verison: 1.0

Description:

Import this template into your zabbix configuration via the import button under configuration>templates.

The template does the work for discovering the consumables in the printer has and will display them accordingly. 

I loosely based this off the following bash script for Nagios Monitoring: http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Hardware/Printers/check_snmp_printer/details

The script should also be included in the git repo, but I cannot gauruntee it is the most up to date.
